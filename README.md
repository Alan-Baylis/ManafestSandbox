# Manafest: Sandbox

This is a fork of [another project](https://github.com/blukatstudios/ManafestArena)
that aims to simply provide a sandbox voxel world for the player to explore
and interact with. Inspiration comes heavily from Minecraft's alpha builds,
and the intention here is to provide something simple, dirty, and functional
to serve as a proof of concept and/or a tech demo.

As a sandbox, there will be no victory condition. There will likewise be no
combat. This game is intended only as a toy and a tech demo that can be refined
and ported to other projects to provide the terrain.


## Development

Currently the following pieces are completely absent:
- Actor moving around (with all stats, inventory, and items temporarily nuked)
- Terrain generation
- Terrain Saving/Loading
- Break blocks
- Place blocks
